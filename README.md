======================

The Histogram module allows you to generate a histogram for images in nodes.

The module creates a new field type and widget called "histogram". Once attached to a node, it will automatically create a histogram for the image field on the node when the node is saved. Currently, it only supports one image field per node per histogram field.

It can create stacked three color histograms as well as merged histograms. The background color can be set to any hexadecimal value. These options can be selected on an image by image basis.
